I wanted to create a multiplayer game with simple base mechanics but high replayablity and fun.

Each player controls a ball rolling around on a floating platform. 
As you roll, the tiles beneath you are painted in your color. 
If another player then rolls over these tiles, they become THEIR color. 
The balls also have high elasticity, meaning that bumping your opponent off 
the platform (making them lose time due to a delayed respawn) is always an option. 
The goal is to have your color covering the most tiles by the end of the timed round.

The game is playable in its current state, but I have many more ideas and improvements I plan 
to implement such as support up to four players, adding new platform maps, 
adding a flipping animation to the tiles changing color, and making the game playable online as opposed to just locally.

Efforts to add contoller compatability are underway and as such movement may feel a bit more slippery than intended. 
This should hopefully be remedied in the next update.
